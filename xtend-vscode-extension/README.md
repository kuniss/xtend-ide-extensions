## Development Hints
This extension was initially created using [VS Code's Yeoman templates](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension), running `yo code` and selecting the `New Language` option.

The Textmate "grammar" was developed using the syntax highlighting grammar editor [*Iro*](https://eeyo.io/iro/) and the .plist/.json transformation tool http://json2plist.sinaapp.com/.

For working on the TextMate "grammar" please consider using the *Iro* specifcaton file ../Xtend.iro.
